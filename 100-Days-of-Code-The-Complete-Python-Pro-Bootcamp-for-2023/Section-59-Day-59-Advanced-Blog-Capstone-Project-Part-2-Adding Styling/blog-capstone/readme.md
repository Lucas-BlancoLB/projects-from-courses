# Capstone Project README
**Issue Encountered**

One of the challenges I encountered during my capstone project was with implementing dynamic URL routing using Flask and Jinja. Specifically, I struggled with passing values dynamically in the anchor tags using the url_for('post_pg', index_id=index_id) function. While I could confirm that the value was being passed correctly, Flask returned an error indicating that index_id was not defined.

Despite verifying the passage of the value, the application failed to function as expected. Interestingly, the issue seemed to be related to the rendering of the post_pg.html template. When attempting to create a new template, such as new.html, the application worked without any issues.

**Next Steps**

To address this issue, I'll explore others solutions and continue progressing through the course despite its strong emphasis on web development. While navigating through the challenges ahead, I'm confident that I'll gain a better understanding of Flask and Jinja, drawing from my experience with previous challenges in the course.
